Stored in db on table 'sales'.

'sales' data is generated as follows:
1) We start with about 25 separate files split by zip code.
2) Run ingestion script, which consolidates all files and adds a Zip Code column based on file name.
3) Run wrangling script 1, which de-dupes the population, groups all records by Address, and appends a Sales Count column.  Also creates IndexMonth, based on CloseDate.
4) Run wrangling script 2 (designed by Sabel), which provides ListDate and IndexMonth2 (which is based on ListDate).  Outputs file named "CompiledDataWithListDate" (look in Dan's local folder titled "Run3_Dan-FurtherWrangling" for this file).
5) Rename "CompiledDateWithListDate" to "sales".

Zipped folder contains each individual zipcode-level file.

# Days on Housing Market Predictor (DHMP)
Georgetown Data Science Days on Housing Market Predictor (DHMP) Project

# Objective 

This project will seek to model the impact of relevant parameters on the duration of time a given property remains available on the D.C. housing market (i.e. before final sale).  Our group plans to use machine learning in order to produce the model.


# Project Layout 

- Source Data : Contains all raw source data and final, wrangled .csv files loaded into database.  Ingestion & wrangling scripts are located in folders where applicable. 

- Ingestion and Wrangling Scripts: Includes code used to ingest raw data, as well as to wrangle the data into a format appropriate for our database (and eventual machine learning). 

- Database: Contains database, SQL scripts, and output file(s) used for machine learning.

- Visualization: includes files and documentation related to visualizing data. 

- Applications: includes codes and link to developed data product application.

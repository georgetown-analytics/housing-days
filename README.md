# Days on Housing Market Predictor (DHMP)
Georgetown Data Science Days on Housing Market Predictor Project

# Objective 

This project will seek to model the impact of relevant parameters on the duration of time a given property remains available on the D.C. housing market (i.e. before final sale).  Our group plans to use machine learning in order to produce the model.


# Project Layout
